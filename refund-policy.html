    <p>Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.</p>

  <p>
    If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll 
    receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.
  </p>
